This is a code to analyze chi files obtained from measurements at the BL40B2 beamline at SPring-8.
It performs transmittance correction and subtracts the solvent data from the sample data.
The calculation results are obtained as a csv file for each sample.
Absolute scattering intensity correction is not performed.

Please use this code at your own risk.
